## linked lists
Linked lists is a data structure to typically keep an unordered sequence of
items. Insertion & deletion are *constant* time. All other operations are linear
with respect to the number of elements.

When solving problems with linked lists, there are several tricks to keep in
mind:
    * recursion
    * copying a node into another
    * two runners; one fast, one slow
        * can be used to find loops in corrupted linked lists
