 * Question 
 *
 * Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all
 * the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D
 * linked lists).
 *
 * Approach
 * - Do breadth first search, but everytime you pop something off the queue you
 *   add it to the linked list for that level.
